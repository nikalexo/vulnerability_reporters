# Experiments
The scipts in this folder perform several experiments on the data processed before to analyze vulnerability reporting.

## Usage
<pre>
python run_all_experiments.py   # run all experiments
python run_all_experiments.py 1 2  # e.g. to run only experiments 1 and 2
</pre>
The experiments are called in seperate functions that receive values loaded in run_all_experiments.py but shared by two or more experiments.  
The results of the experiments are stored into results/ and a specific directory for each experiment.

Checkout the following point to find out which hypthesis belongs to which function and result.

## Investigated hypothesis/experiments

1. **Heavy tailed.** The number of reports per reporter follows a heavy-tailed distribution.
    - ***Function:*** experiments.reporter_distribution(...)
    - ***Results:*** results/reporter_distribution/
2. **Increasing.** The number of reporters is increasing over time.
    - ***Function:*** experiments.number_reporters_over_time(...)
    - ***Results:*** results/reporter_dev_over_time/
    - ***Parameters:*** 
        - *begin:* first year to include (default: 2000)
        - *end:* last year to include (default: 2020)
3. **Cross-project.** Most reporters have reported vulnerabilities for more than one of these projects.
    - ***Function:*** experiments.multiple_projects(...)
    - ***Results:*** results/reporter_across_projects/
4. **Honeymoon effect.** The reporting rate of reporters with multiple reports starts slow and then picks up, independently for each project.
    - ***Function:*** experiments.reporting_rate(...)
    - ***Results:*** results/reporter_reporting_rate/
    - ***Parameters:*** 
        - *begin:* first year to include (default: 2000)
        - *end:* last year to include (default: 2020)
5. **Drop-out.** The reporting rate of reporters with multiple reports drops after reaching a peak, with reporters stopping providing reports altogether within two years.
    - ***Function:*** experiments.reporting_rate(...)
    - ***Results:*** results/reporter_reporting_rate/
    - ***Parameters:*** 
        - *begin:* first year to include (default: 2000)
        - *end:* last year to include (default: 2020)
6. **Specialized.** Reporters show statistically significant bias toward specific types of vulnerabilities.
    - ***Function:*** experiments.reps_and_their_vulnerability_types(...)
    - ***Results:*** results/reporters_type_vulnerabilities/
7. **Bounties.** Most vulnerability reporters have been awarded bug bounties.
    - ***Function:*** experiments.bug_bounties(...)
    - ***Results:*** results/reporters_bug_bounties/
8. **Security expertise.** A significant portion (over 33\%) of vulnerability reporters mention something security-related in their social media professional networking profiles.
    - ***Function:*** experiments.social_media_sec_rel(...)
    - ***Results:*** results/reporters_social_media_sec_related/
9. **Reputation.** Most reporters explicitly mention vulnerability discoveries in their online professional networking profiles.
    - ***Function:*** experiments.social_media_reputation(...)
    - ***Results:*** results/reporters_social_media_reputation/
    - ***Parameters:*** 
        - *search_re:* keywords to search for (default: r'vulnerabilit', r'security bug', r'CVE-\d{4}', r'fuzz', r'security')
10. **Employed.** A significant portion (over 33\%) of reporters come from within the corresponding organizations.
    - ***Function:*** experiments.reporters_employed(...)
    - ***Results:*** results/reporters_employed/
11. **Committers.** Most vulnerability reporters are committers.
    - ***Function:*** experiments.reporters_commiters(...)
    - ***Results:*** results/reporters_commiters/
12. **Bug reporters.** Reporters regularly find and report other (non-security) bugs. Non-security bugs reported by vulnerability reporters are different than the rest.
    - ***Function:*** experiments.bugs_reporters
    - ***Results:*** results/reporters_non_security_bugs/
    - ***Parameters:*** 
        - **key_words:* key-words to search for in bugs (default: memory, memory issue, crash, security)
        - *top_percentage:* list of top percentages of reporters to investigate (measured by reported cves). 1 is always included (default: 0.5)
13. **Patched.** A significant portion (over 33\%) of reporters fix the vulnerabilities that they reported.
    - ***Function:*** experiments.reporters_fixing_vulnerabilities(...)
    - ***Results:*** results/reporters_fixing_vulnerabilities/
14. **Knowledge transfer.** If a developer has fixed a vulnerability in the past, they are more likely to report a new vulnerability.
    - ***Function:*** experiments.reporters_fixing_vulnerabilities(...)
    - ***Results:*** results/reporters_fixing_vulnerabilities/
